“The most important thing is to bring your cat to the vet for care before you do anything,” says Dr. Rachel Barrack, a licensed veterinarian and certified veterinary acupuncturist.

 

Dr. Barrack says some more severe symptoms that cat owners should watch out for include difficulty breathing, increased eye or nasal discharge, increased lethargy or a refusal to eat or drink. This is why you should initially make sure to see a vet instead of first trying to treat the problem at home.

 

“These are all signs that more care is required. It’s easy to think that when your cat has a cold, there’s nothing to worry about, but I think it’s better to err on the side of caution,” says Dr. Barrack. “It’s easier to treat in the early stages.”
